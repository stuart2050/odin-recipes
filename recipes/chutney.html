    <h3>20 mins to prepare and 2 hrs to cook</h3>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5kg red onions, thinly slice</li>
        <li>300g dark muscavado sugar</li>
        <li>200ml red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp pomegranite mollasses</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes, dried</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayennes pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sterilise glass jars, wash in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Dry in the oven for 15-20 mins at gas 1, 140°C, fan 120°C until hot and completely dry. Boil metal lids and rubber seals for 10 mins, then leave to dry.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan and gently fry the onions over a medium-low heat for 25-30 mins, stirring regularly. The onions should be softened but not browned, and reduced by about half.</li>
        <li>Stir in 3 tbsp of the sugar, increase the heat, and cook for 7-10 mins, stirring occasionally, until the onions are just starting to colour. Lower the heat, then add the remaining sugar, ½ tsp salt and all the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Simmer, uncovered, so it bubbles gently on a medium-low heat for 30-40 mins, or until the chutney has reduced and thickened to a dark caramel colour, stirring occasionally to check it isn’t sticking to the bottom of the pan. To test if the chutney is ready, drag a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan – it should take a few seconds for the juices to re-cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Spoon the hot chutney into cooled, sterilised jars*, then seal and label. The chutney will keep for up to 6-12 months.</li>
    </ol>
