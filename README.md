# odin-recipes
This current project is going to involve me creating a simple recipe website. 

In this project, I will create: 

- An index, homepage. 
- Several recipes. 

The skills I will learn: 

- HTML
- Pages
- Using GIT Hub to Stage, commit and leave notes on how to use this service. 
- Adding images and other media to the website. 

I will come back here and reflect on what I have actually learned afterwards.
